Sie steht der Partei DIE LINKE nahe. \nVorrangige Aufgabe der Stiftung ist die politische Bildung. Die Stiftung fördert mit ihrer Arbeit eine kritische Gesellschaftsanalyse, progressive kulturelle Ansätze sowie die Vernetzung emanzipatorischer Akteure. Sie agiert international im Feld der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit und des gleichberechtigten Dialogs und dokumentiert mit Hilfe des Archivs des demokratischen Sozialismus wichtige Ergebnisse linker Politik. Darüber hinaus fördert sie im Rahmen ihres Studienwerks den wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs mit Stipendien.\n\n[en] The Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung is one of the largest foundations dedicated to political education in Germany today, and stands in the intellectual and political tradition of democratic socialism. Initiated in 1990 as a small political association in Berlin known as “Gesellschaftsanalyse und politische Bildung e. V.”, it has since grown into a nationwide organization encompassing political education, discussion forums for critical thought and political alternatives, as well a research facility for progressive social analysis.\n\nRSS-Feed: http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:5251722/sounds.rss \nImpressum: https://www.rosalux.de/impressum/\nNewsletter und Themenverteiler: https://info.rosalux.de",
